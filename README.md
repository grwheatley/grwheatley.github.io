# grwheatley.github.io

1. Genevieve Wheatley: genevievewheatley8@gmail.com for github
2. I'm new to the platform and excited to learn and collaborate. Currently, my account hosts a single repository created for a class lab. Stay tuned for future assignments and projects! Looking forward to growing and contributing in the GitHub community.
3. This repository is currently blank until we start adding files, writing code, or collaborating with others to build something.
4. I clicked on the file tab in the top left of the github desktop screen, clicked on clone repository, then chose grwheatley.github.io as this is the only repository currently on my account, chose my labs folder within my CTI.110 folder on my desktop and clicked on clone repository. It is now available in my CTI.110 folder, inside of my “labs” folder.
